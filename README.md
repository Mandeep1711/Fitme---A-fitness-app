# Fitme-A-fitness-app
FITME is a C++ console-based fitness app that offers personalized workouts, diet plans, BMI tracking, and a virtual fitness shop. Built using object-oriented programming and file handling, it provides a simple and interactive way to manage health and wellness.

Overview:

FITME helps bridge the gap between fitness planning and technology. It uses core C++ concepts such as object-oriented programming, file handling, and console UI enhancement to simulate a basic fitness experience for users.

Technologies Used:

- Programming Language: C++
- Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Structures), File Handling, Pointers, Arrays, Functions
- Libraries: conio.h, fstream.h, dos.h, string.h, ctype.h

Logic and Design:

- The core logic is written using a single user class that stores all user data.
- Separate functions handle sign up, login, BMI calculation, workout/diet selection, shopping, helpdesk, and status updates.
- File handling ensures that user data is saved and reused.
- Console animations (like colored text, blinking effects, and delay functions) make the UI more engaging.

How to Run the App:

- Install Turbo C++ or use DOSBox to run legacy C++ code.
